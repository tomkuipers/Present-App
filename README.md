Present-App
===========

The app allows attendees to ask questions (anonymously) about a presentation or lecture. The submitted questions are shown in real-time to all other attendees using the app. Attendees can cast votes for questions, which will produce a most-wanted list of questions the lecturer can address and the end of the presentation or lecture.

The 'Present!' mobile webapp is a submission for the [Apps On](http://www.surfnet.nl/nl/Thema/appson/Pages/Default.aspx) (in Dutch) contest.
